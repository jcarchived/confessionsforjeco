        title: "Buzz",
        content: `<p>As I think back to those fleeting moments, it reminds me of the first time I met him—the quiet confidence that lingered in his presence, even amidst the chaos of the world.</p>
        <p>The first time I met him was in the Science Innovation Expo Office of our school, The Antiheroes. The loud air conditioner met my thin skin that made me shiver from comfort. I held my books tight to my chest as I try to find a seat from the infinitesimal people within that space.</p>
        <p>In our school, The Antiheroes were the epitome of academic excellence. A place in that circle would guarantee a place in a prestigious school—Ateneo, De La Salle, San Carlos—and everyone wanted in on the prestige. But with great prestige comes great responsibility; it was expected from us to stand on all podiums on all contests.</p>
        <p>I was always curious why the office was named, The Antiheroes. It wasn't exactly fitting for the image of being academically prestigious. But then, the more I thought about it, the more I remember what my senior told me a few years back—they were the ones who created The Antiheroes back then. He said, “We were here to break the rules, to challenge everything people thought we should be. And that's how we always come out on top.</p>
        <p>In a space filled with high expectations and stiff competition, I felt out of place, clutching my bag like a lifeline. That's when I saw him—the boy that I didn't know I'll love—waving over me with a smile that somehow made the room feel less intimidating.</p>
        <p>I sat next to the guy who reserved a seat for me. His bag was placed onto the chair so he grabbed it and placed it below him. I placed all my things on the table and opened my laptop. I scour the internet for some interesting topics, something that truly interests me. I got it! AI for Criminal Profiling: The—</p>
        <p>“Hey, got a pencil?” a tap on my shoulder pulled me out of my thoughts. I slid off my earphones, placing them on the wooden table, and glanced over at him—a boy with tousled hair and a wide grin.</p>
        <p>“Uh, yeah, hold on,” I rummaged through my book bag, fishing out a pencil and handing it over.</p>
        <p>“Thanks,” he grinned, twirling the pencil around his fingers. He extended his free hand towards me and said, “I'm Jeco.”</p>
        <p>“JC.” I replied, shaking his hand and feeling the warmth he gave.</p>
        <p>“So, Physical Sciences, huh?” he glanced over my notes and chuckled slightly.</p>
        <p>“Yeah, kind of overwhelming,” I replied before returning the question. “What about you?”</p>
        <p>“Life Sciences,” his smile deepened, and for a second, his eyes crinkled, making it hard to tell what he was thinking. “Guess we'll be the ones holding the ‘sciences’ part of this office,” he jokingly remarked.</p>
        <p>I chuckled softly, glancing at the busy journalists around us. “I suppose so. Although, it seems they have their own world going on,” I commented.</p>
        <p>He leaned over to me, lowering his voice. “But I bet our world is more fun,”</p>
        <p>In the fleeting moments, the world fell quiet. All voices diffuse into one hush. Silence rang in our ears as we share my earphones—his on the right, mine on the left. The buzz of coffee flowing through my veins, it made me jitter like a little kid on a sugar high.</p>
        <p>Sharing the music created a world just for us, where words weren't necessary. In those silent moments, I started to realize Jeco wasn't just kind—he had a way of making me feel seen.</p>
        <p>I shifted myself slightly, letting our knees touch. The coarse fabric of his jeans warmed my skin, and when he didn't pull away, I was reassured—it meant something. As a researcher, I tried another experiment. I let my hand fall towards his thigh and he looked at me.</p>
        <p>My cheeks flushed as he smiled, unbothered. Even as I pulled away, I couldn't stop giggling quietly, maroon-faced. My heart was beating—was it him or the coffee talking?</p>
        <p>The day of the contest came and I was getting busy than ever. There was no time to be distracted now, everything had to go right for us. Jeco and I were sent into different rooms to prepare—alone in a blue room with only our coach, a TV, a laptop, and our phones.</p>
        <p>The nerves buzzed throughout my body like electricity. There was no room for mistakes—not with everything we've sacrificed on the line. I focused on my presentation, but a thought lingers in my mind, how's Jeco doing in his own room?</p>
        <p>The contest ended in an instant; I breathe a sigh of relief. It was finally over. I clapped when they said Ash's name, presenting his study on the big screen—his big smile with his eyes hidden from the rest of the world.</p>
        <p>When it ended, his steps began from walking to sprinting as he rushed down to greet me—standing there in the corner of the gymnasium. His hands opened and embraced the heart, the trophy left on the hands of his coach. I could smell his strawberry scent from far away.</p>
        <p>When Jeco sprinted towards me, his joy was contagious. I couldn't help but smile as he wrapped me in his embrace. In that moment, surrounded by applause and cameras, I felt something I hadn't expected—a certainty that comes once in a million years.</p>
        <p>I had come here for one thing—to prove myself. But standing there, with him, it wasn’t just about that anymore. I didn’t need to be perfect. I didn’t need to be anyone else. I felt like I mattered, just as I was.</p>
        <p>Maybe that’s what love was—a moment when you stop searching for validation and realize that being seen, truly seen, was enough.</p>
        <p>And maybe... maybe that was all I needed to know.</p>`,

        title: "When Xian Was Here",
        content: `<p>I don't believe in forever.</p>
        <p>I finalized this idea when someone dear left me alone. In that moment, my idea of the world smashed before me. I always saw it as a myriad of colors but now, all its hues were washed away by tears. How I miss the joys of being with him one last time.</p>
        <p>For years, I've pondered whether people truly believe in forever—while I sip my coffee, prepare my documents, commute to school—the answer still eludes me. It's not that I couldn't answer it—the answer just holds so much power that I can't even put it into words. But, I finally had my answer.</p>
        <p>As always, I place my backpack on the chair beside me. Original. I unzipped the bag, taking out my yellow laptop. Xian always liked yellow. He says it reminds him of daffodils—another one of his favorite antics. I always came around with a few daffodils I caught from a nearby park—yeah, I guess I was kinda trespassing but I did it for love, anyway.</p>
        <p>“Jeno, hey!” Beatrice walked in, waving at me. I waved back, giving her a soft smile before returning back to typing on my computer. “Sorry, I'm late, traffic was so bad in EDSA,” she placed her things on the table, sitting on the chair adjacent to mine. “No worries, glad you could make it,” I reply before she rambled about how to go along with this project. I exhale, pushing my thoughts of Xian aside. Reality calls and I have a project to do.</p>
        <p>“Can we talk about this later? We still have to wait for Hugh, anyway,” I ask her. She agreed and got herself busy playing on her phone. Hugh came out of nowhere, entering the library and catching our attention. “Speaking of the devil...” Beatrice murmurs under her breath and gives Hugh a gentle smile.</p>
        <p>We started with the project a few minutes later. Hugh was busy arranging his stuff while Beatrice gives her a side-eye. Beatrice and Hugh were exes, CRAZY exes. Beatrice broke up with Hugh because he was cheating on her with her best friend. Now, they're together—well, that was what Xian told me. Xian was always up into the new gossip in school and I was always eager to show interest.</p>
        <p>As I write notes on my notepad, I catch a glimpse of someone. He was wearing an Original Ms. Dior Blooming cologne on his yellow and white knitted vest. He was wearing a short-sleeved polo underneath and white pants—some of my favorite outfits I found in someone's closet. He was reaching for a book called When Haru Was Here—I remember I used to give that book to—</p>
        <p>Xian.</p>
        <p>My heart starts beating out of my chest. I couldn't keep my breathing under control, it was erratic. I tried to compose myself but his cologne still lingers and plays with my sense of smell—I just couldn't hold back.</p>
        <p>“Excuse me for a moment,” I smile before pushing my chair back and walking towards the guy. I just needed to ask Xian what went wrong and I would be on my way. I just need one reason, an acceptable reason why he threw out a year of pure love. I reached out to him, extending my right arm when—“Jeno, come tell Hugh he's being an asshole,”</p>
        <p>I looked back, seeing Beatrice and Hugh bickering again. They were throwing some crumpled paper on each other. Beatrice had enough so she moved a few seats away from Hugh. They both roll their eyes at each other before continuing with their work, acting like nothing happened. Guess I had to clean up those papers.</p>
        <p>I look back, expecting that Xian was still around....but he was gone. He just disappeared out of the blue just as easily as he came. No sound, no steps, nothing. There was no trace of him but his scent was still lingering in my nose. A book was left slightly pulled back from the bookshelf on my right—When Haru Was Here. It was if like, he was here, just...gone.</p>
        <p>Of course, Xian wasn't here. Why would he be?</p>
        <p>By the afternoon, I came into my usual coffee shop—Cafe Berry. Xian introduced me to the cafe, he said they had the best coffee and cake they had. Fun fact, it was one of the very first hangout places and dates we had. He would always order a blueberry cheesecake and iced macchiato—wait, I'm sorry. I ramble about Xian too much for my own good.</p>
        <p>The waiter came along to take my order. “Good afternoon, what would you like to order?” she asks. I give her a faint smile before looking back at the menu. “Ohayo, I would like—” I stammer to find my words. I stopped completely. Right. Just for me now. I give a bearing smile.</p>
        <p>“A-a blueberry cheesecake and an iced macchiato, please. Dine in,” I reply, giving her a smile again. She took notes about my order and went back to the kitchen.</p>
        <p>I scrolled through my phone—Beatrice told me that to forget about Xian was to forget everything that made me remember him: the photos, the videos, any remnants of him. I scrolled through my pictures, seeing how happy we were. I saw a photo of our date here in Cafe Berry. He had a foam mustache, smiling for the camera as he leaned his head towards the left side of my chest, my past self laughing. I could hear the sound—but that was all imaginary. It was just pixels on a screen. Nothing more.</p>
        <p>I catch a glimpse of Xian again, this time, outside the cafe. He was holding a few shopping bags from Zara and National Book Store, two of his favorite shops. He was on his phone, talking to someone I do not know. It was as if he was just going about his life like usual, like nothing has changed.</p>
        <p>This time, I wanted to meet him now. I wanted to talk to him. I don't care if he looks busy. I push my seat from the table and ran towards him but I stopped. I heard the call of the waiter again. “Sir, your order is ready,” I looked back again. My order of blueberry cheesecake and iced macchiato. I looked back at where Xian was, but he was nowhere. I ran to the escalator, he wasn't there. I looked around, he wasn't there either. I walked back to the cafe and thanked the waiter for waiting.</p>
        <p>“Sir, where's your usual date?” she asked. I smile and swayed my head. She was taken aback. I could sense that she probably regretted her question. “No, it's okay, we stayed here for long times usually, now it's gone,” I reply, before giving her a sweet smile. She smiled back and lowered her head, walking back to the kitchen.</p>
        <p>After finishing up my afternoon snack, Alice contacted me. Alice was a mutual friend of Xian and I, she was always there for us. But now, she seemed distant—maybe because she has a new boyfriend.</p>
        <p>‘Jeno, can you come to the art room for a little bit? I left something there, is that okay?’</p>
        <p>I give her a thumbs up in text, adding a smiling emoji next to it. I give a sigh of relief—was I ready to face the art room again? I mean, Xian and I always hung out at the art room.</p>
        <p>I didn't have time to think. I didn't know how I got there, or when—it felt like the passage of time and my thoughts were interjecting with itself—but I was standing in front of the art room. I take a deep sigh, twisting the doorknob of the room. The room was dark, like it was abandoned. Cobwebs on the walls, like no one was inhabiting that place anymore. Alice says that she left an artwork in here, but which? There's tons of hidden artworks here. She told me it was covered by a tan, linen cloth. I ripped off the cover on the first painting I saw—there were two of them—and came out...</p>
        <p>Alice's painting.</p>
        <p>“Finally!” I shout. Then I hear creative humming. It wasn't creepy humming, but just humming. Humming to a tune I couldn't place right now. I notice Xian sitting again, in a loose, white shirt. He was holding his pink paintbrush I gifted him on his birthday. He was sitting on a stool, painting on an easel. He had his headphones on, was this my chance to ask him?</p>
        <p>I stammer. What's my right to ask him why he broke up with me? I should apologize. I did something wrong, I'm sure of it, but I can't pinpoint it right now. My thoughts continue to ramble, precariously telling me I should go run up to him and beg until the door slams shut, echoing throughout the room. Xian didn't flinch, instead, he painted on the same easel, in the same pace, unbothered.</p>
        <p>“Xian...” I speak, reaching out and extending my right hand again. I was about to grab him but I stopped, turning my hands into fists. I completely regretted my decision. Xian probably noticed me because he lowered his paintbrush and his headphones. The sound of Twice's Cry For Me echoing through his headphones—one of his favorite songs. He was about to turn towards me until...</p>
        <p>“You're here?” it wasn't Xian's voice, it was someone else behind me. I looked back and I saw Ms. Perez holding her textbooks close to her chest. Ms. Perez was one of his art teachers, always pushing him to be the best and express freely in his artworks.</p>
        <p>“Yeah, sorry, my friend just wanted me to get some of her stuff,” I looked back, Xian was gone. However, a small indention left on the stool as if someone just sat there—proof that he was here, breathing, touching....feeling.</p>
        <p>“Did you know, he used to sit in that stool? He was always persistent that he sits in that exact stool. He could recognize that chair for miles,” she recalls, laughing about the moment. I snicker, laughing with her. I grabbed Alice's painting beside me and looked at Xian's painting, a portrait of me with a reference picture attached on the far left. A date written on the bottom right, my birthday—4 months ago.</p>
        <p>“Shame what happened to him,”</p>
        <p>“What?”</p>
        <p>“Take care...Jeno,”</p>
        <p>I stammer, hugging Alice's painting close to my chest. What did she mean about that? That's a weird passive comment, right? I wasn't the only one who heard that, right? Right? Right.</p>
        <p>‘Jeno, where are you?’</p>
        <p>‘I'm coming, Alice. Be there in a second,’</p>
        <p>I reached Alice's apartment. She unlocked the door and got the painting and placed it on the chair near the door. She grabbed my wrist and locked her apartment, dragging me out. “Where are we going?” I ask her. “Clubbing, haven't caught up with you in a long time and I feel like you need some time off,” she replied. I was arguing with her that I didn't want to go but she insisted, besides, my name and hers was already written on a table in Club Tipsy.</p>
        <p>We reached the bar, half-tipsy as to not waste our money in booze too much. A few minutes and I already had too much to drink. Added plus because there was a famous person that entered the bar, someone called Mino.</p>
        <p>I reached for the backdoor and puked all over the place. I try to walk it off and then I brushed someone's shoulder. “Sorry,” I murmur but the guy stopped. “Jeno.... it's me,” I looked back, it was Xian smiling wide and having her usual radiant behavior and aura. “Xian...” I say, before pointing my pointer finger up at him and puking, asking for a second.</p>
        <p>I look back at him, staring as he radiates glow and softness from each passing second. The reality now sinks in to me. This was my chance. He couldn't escape it now. He had to answer. I have to ask it.</p>
        <p>“I wish I never met you,”</p>
        <p>“Why?”</p>
        <p>“You ruined love for me, Xian,” I bite my lip. How could I say such a thing? The perfect guy was standing right in front of me and I was just saying what I can at the top of my head.</p>
        <p>“How so?”</p>
        <p>“You set the bar too high,”</p>
        <p>“Isn't that a good thing?”</p>
        <p>“But how am I gonna find someone new now?”</p>
        <p>The words kept coming out of my mouth. I said those words but did I really mean it? I mean, I did not think about finding another one to replace Xian, was I trying to replace him?</p>
        <p>“Back up—” Xian laughs, masking what I assume his complete obliviousness as to what I meant. “I don't understand...”</p>
        <p>“If the relationship was rocky, I could've written you as an asshole a long time ago,”</p>
        <p>“So, because it was genuine...” Xian starts connecting the dots but I added into his murmur. “I'm afraid I'm never going to find that again,”</p>
        <p>“It truly hurt when you left, Xian. Every part of me was aching for you,”</p>
        <p>“I know, I'm so sorry for that, Jeno, I...” Xian reached out to me, caressing my arms. I could feel the warmth of his touch, something I was deprived of for months. “I haven't let anyone else in after you,”</p>
        <p>“Why?”</p>
        <p>“I'm afraid of being hurt again,”</p>
        <p>“You know what that does, right? It turns into you hurting yourself,” Jeno explains. I never really thought of it that way. “You're....DEPRIVING yourself of new experiences, which is meant to lead to growth,” he adds.</p>
        <p>“I mean, remember when we were little, Tita Baby told you to learn how to swim but you kept sinking? Did you quit after each trial? No! You tried again, over and over again,” he recalls an experience we had. Xian and I were childhood friends, always through thick and thin until we got together in high school.</p>
        <p>“It was really funny but it showed how persistent you were,”</p>
        <p>“Xian.... It's terrifying, I—”</p>
        <p>“You know why love is awesome? Because it's scary,”</p>
        <p>“And the thrill comes from the fear. Just be afraid! Everyone is!” Xian encourages me. I give him a slight smile and proceeds to caress his cheeks.</p>
        <p>“Promise me something, Jeno,”</p>
        <p>“Anything,”</p>
        <p>“Don't try to replicate our relationship with someone new,”</p>
        <p>Xian turns to leave but he stops and turns back to me. “And Jeno...it wasn't your fault,” he gives a smile then disappearing from view.</p>
        <p>“You were an amazing boyfriend...”</p>
        <p>_________________________________</p>
        <p>“Hey loveyyyy,” I hear Xian's voice from my phone. It was 8pm on a Tuesday, my Tuesday. I was turning 21 that day, probably the only one I wanted to spend it with was Xian.</p>
        <p>“Heyyyy, how long till you get here?” I ask. Xian was picking me up for dinner today. A dinner for just us. No parents. No friends. It was only us against the world. “About 15, see you soon!!! Can't wait to see you,” he says before hanging up the phone.</p>
        <p>I sit patiently for him at our living room. The clock ticks. 10. No worries, he said it was going to take 15. I turn on the TV, waiting patiently for his arrival. I can't stop looking at my watch, waiting patiently for it to turn 15.</p>
        <p>15. He wasn't here. Strange. He was always ontime when it comes to me but I guess he has a surprise. I try to brush it off as I couldn't grasp as to where or when Xian was getting here, I just know he's close.</p>
        <p>20. My dad notices that I was sitting alone. He knows Xian. He loves Xian. He believes that there's something wrong and so he wants to call Xian. No answer. I called Xian again, no answer still.</p>
        <p>25. At this time, I was panicking. What happened to Xian? I had to do what I knew to do best, pacing in the room. My anxious self in me thought of the worse possible explanation. Was he kidnapped? Did he forget? Did he get lost?</p>
        <p>My dad calls Xian's mom. I could hear them murmuring in their conversation. After the phone call, my dad looks at me. 30.</p>
        <p>“Jeno....Xian's gone,”</p>`,
